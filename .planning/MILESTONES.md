# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-04-06)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 10 plans, 27 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Added `context: fork` to all 15 GSD orchestrator commands so skill prompts execute in isolated sub-agent contexts instead of polluting the parent conversation
- All 18 GSD agent definitions enhanced with typed capability frontmatter (maxTurns, effort, permissionMode) for agent spawning via Claude Code's AgentJsonSchema
- Reduced CLAUDE.md from ~2,338 to ~174 words (~92% reduction) by adding --minimal flag to generate-claude-md that replaces project/stack/conventions/architecture sections with on-demand placeholders
- MCP server with stdio transport exposing 6 read-only GSD resources via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, auto-discovered by Claude Code through .mcp.json
- GSD plugin manifest with MCP metadata, packaged runtime path resolution via CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA, and repo-owned validation
- 60 self-contained skills, 21 agents, 33 templates, 19 references migrated to plugin layout with zero legacy path dependencies
- GSD hooks packaged in hooks/hooks.json and MCP server at mcp/server.cjs with legacy .mcp.json dependency removed
- Phase-completion memory writer using Claude Code memdir with lean project-type memories and auto-recall
- Plugin distribution contract, README with single-step install, legacy migration helper, and clean runtime audit

## v1.1 Session Continuity (Shipped: 2026-04-20)

**Phases completed:** 2 phases (Phase 4 + Phase 5), 5 plans + 4 structurally related quick tasks, over 9 days (2026-04-11 → 2026-04-20). Phase 6 dropped mid-milestone per the 2026-04-20 audit rescope; 7 requirements rehomed to v1.2 backlog.

**Key accomplishments:**

- End-to-end session continuity across `/compact` — PreCompact hook writes HANDOFF.json (19-field schema); SessionStart hook detects it and auto-invokes `/gsd:resume-work`. Live round-trip verified 2026-04-20. Zero user intervention required.
- Hook-independent fallback path via `## Session Continuity` section in CLAUDE.md — provides a second trigger channel for CLIs without hook support or when the hook is overridden. Same skill executes; same end state.
- Full handoff lifecycle — creation, detection, **and cleanup**. `/gsd:resume-work` step 6 invokes `checkpoint --clear` after successful resume, closing the stale-HANDOFF-triggers-phantom-resume failure mode.
- Disciplined mid-milestone rescope — AUDIT-v1.1.md found upstream-compat scope compromised by upstream drift; Option C trimmed aggressively and shipped. Decision trail preserved for clean v1.2 context.
- Hook resolver falls back to newest cached plugin version when baked `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is pruned — opportunistic fix for long-running sessions surviving plugin upgrades (quick task 260420-vfb).
- Plugin-wide `/gsd-<skill>` → `/gsd:<skill>` namespace normalization (273 replacements across 100 files) with durable maintenance script at `bin/maintenance/rewrite-command-namespace.cjs` for post-sync re-runs (quick task 260420-cns).

## v1.2 Upstream Resilience (Shipped: 2026-04-24)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases (Phase 7 + Phase 8 + Phase 9), 3 plans + 14 tasks + 3 structurally related quick tasks, over 5 days (2026-04-20 → 2026-04-24). Zero phase/requirement deferrals — all 9 requirements satisfied by the phase that claimed them at kickoff.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Three-detector drift-catch in CI — file-layout, HANDOFF schema, and namespace drift each fail the build if regressed. Ratchet baselines let the plugin ship with known debt (e.g., 71 Category-B file-layout refs) while preventing further regressions.
- `schema/handoff-v1.json` — committed JSON Schema draft-07 describing the 19-field HANDOFF contract (17 required upstream-compat fields + 2 optional plugin extensions). Research R-1 confirmed upstream schema is stable and plugin is a strict superset.
- `bin/maintenance/check-drift.cjs` umbrella orchestrator — unifies file-layout + schema + namespace drift checks into one entry point for local dev + post-sync use. CI stays per-category for fast-feedback granularity.
- `bin/maintenance/check-upstream-schema.cjs` post-sync detector — compares upstream `/gsd:pause-work` declared field list against our schema; catches upstream drift before it bites users.
- First CI on the repo — `.github/workflows/check-drift.yml` with `file-layout` + `handoff-schema` jobs running in parallel.
- `CHANGELOG.md` scaffold — Keep-a-Changelog format with plugin-vs-upstream version distinction in section headers.
- README reorganized to put new-user flow (install → use → update → maintenance) first; upstream-user migration content consolidated in a trailing umbrella section (quick task 260421-rnu).
- Skill directories renamed `skills/gsd-<name>/` → `skills/<name>/` (81 renames) — fixed a duplicated-prefix UX bug where tab completion inserted `/gsd:gsd-<skill>` instead of `/gsd:<skill>`. Also aligns plugin layout with upstream's `commands/gsd/<name>.md` structure (quick task 260424-srn).
